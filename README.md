# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise has began crowdfunding for her play *Fever*.  Utilizing our Kickstarter dataset, we have been asked to provide Louise with more information regarding the outcomes of other plays when compared to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A pivot table was generated from the entire Kickstarter Dataset in Excel.  The tables goal was to illustrate the outcomes of all Theatre projects in the dataset and to sort those outcomes (Successful, failed, and Canceled) by the month of the year in which each project was launched.  The entire dataset was filtered by *Parent Category* and by *year*.  The *Year* item was generated by creating a column in the dataset and extracting the year from the complete launch date using the **YEAR()** function in Excel.  The *Date created conversion* comlumn column was chosen as teh row, and both the **Column** and **Value** were set to *Outcomes*

The pivot table result can be seen below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The next task was to evaluate project outcomes compared to their fund raising goals.  For this, I utilized the **COUNTIFS ()** function in Excel to create a table that counts the number of *Plays* that were **Successful, Failed, or Canceled** inside predetermined *goal* amounts.

I then summed the **Successful, Failed, and Canceled** projects to calculate the total projects for each *goal* range.  A percentage Sccessful, Failed, or Canceled could then be caclculated by dividing the Number of either successful, failed, or canceled projects by the calculated total projects.

The completed table can be seen below.

A line chart was then created.  First I selected the line chart function in the insert ribbon.  I then set the Horizontal Axis Item to the goal range column.  I then set each series and the corresponding **Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage Canceled** values.

THe final chart can be seen below.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Fortunately the dataset outcomes had a standardized set of results.  Had the data posessed different values other than **Succeeful, Failed, or Canceled** they would have had to be reconciled to inculde all pertinent information.  I have personally used the *COUNTIFS* function before, but not had known syntax to chose values greater than a certain amount.  I was unaware that the the formula required ">Value" for the function to work.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.  The highest success rates and total launch dates are in May and June respectively; likewise, the failure rate *31.3%* is less than average *36.5%* for all months.
2.  December has the lowest project attempts and successes.  
3.  In general, the success to failure rate is consistent compared to the number of project attempts with the exceptions of May, June, July and December.  The months of May through July appear to have higher overall success rates; while December appears to have much lower than the average.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The best success rates happen with goal values lower than $4999.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1.  The Dataset does not define which Market the plays were being sold in.  It distinguishes the country, but regional sub categories could help Louise determine where her play fits in.  
2.  The goal values should be converted to a common currency for more accurate representation of value and risk.  A Euro is worth more than a dollar.  Direct comparison skews the goal and pledge amounts compared to louise's values.  
3.  The Type of Play is hard to distinguish.  It would be difficult to sort whether the play was a comedy, drama, etc from the blurp alone, but it could also be valuable for louise to compare her play versus similar of type and not just the subcategory *play*.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1.  Compare outcome with backers and month.  Determine the optimal time that people appear to support plays and donate.
2.  Compare backer # to Goal amount.  Will people invest if they think the value is too high and it won't get funded?
3.  Total days to fund versus goal.
